# NFL-Weather-viz
data analysis project based on nfl scores and weather data

scrap.py pulls the data of every nfl game score, wind, and temperature from 2009-2019. This gets saved to unclean.csv

clean.py cleans the data that was just scraped. This also gets saved to clean.csv

visualization.py creates graphs which are automatically saved to the graphs folder and prints the different statstically data to the terminal
